      <h2>Overview of Corporations in the U.S.</h2>
      <p><b>Understanding Corporations</b></p>
      <ul class="expat-list">
        <li>A corporation is a distinct legal entity established under the laws of the state in which it is incorporated. Each state has its own regulations governing the formation, management, and dissolution of corporations, with many adopting frameworks similar to the Model Business Corporation Act.</li>
        <li>To form a corporation, articles of incorporation must be filed with the state’s Secretary of State, outlining key details such as the corporation’s structure, bylaws, and operational rules.</li>
        <li>Most corporations adopt bylaws to define the roles, rights, and responsibilities of directors, officers, and shareholders.</li>
        <li>States also require corporations incorporated elsewhere to register for permission to conduct business within their borders.</li>
        <li>Federal laws, notably the Securities Act of 1933, regulate the issuance and sale of corporate securities, imposing fiduciary duties such as full disclosure to shareholders and investors.</li>
        <li>Corporations are treated as legal "persons," granting them the ability to own property, enter contracts, sue, or be sued independently of their shareholders. This separation shields shareholders from personal liability for corporate debts and allows for easy transfer of ownership through shares.</li>
        <li>Corporations also have perpetual existence, meaning the death or departure of shareholders or officers does not affect their legal structure.</li>
        <li>Corporations face a unique tax structure, distinct from individuals. While they encounter "double taxation"—where both corporate profits and shareholder dividends are taxed—corporate tax rates are generally lower than individual income tax rates.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Features of a Corporation</h2>
      <ul class="expat-list">
        <li><b>Legal Entity:</b> Authorized by state law, a corporation operates as a separate entity, capable of owning assets, entering contracts, and engaging in legal proceedings.</li>
        <li><b>Formation:</b> Requires filing articles of incorporation with the state’s Secretary of State, detailing bylaws, shareholder rights, directors, officers, and operational guidelines.</li>
        <li><b>Recognition:</b> Recognized as a legal business entity across all 50 U.S. states.</li>
        <li><b>Perpetual Existence:</b> The corporation continues to exist regardless of changes in ownership or leadership.</li>
        <li><b>Taxation:</b> Subject to corporate tax on profits, with potential additional taxation on dividends distributed to shareholders.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="expat-section">
      <h2>Types of Corporations: C Corporation vs. S Corporation</h2>
      <ul class="expat-list">
        <li><b>C Corporation:</b> The default structure for all corporations upon formation. Profits are taxed at the corporate level, and dividends distributed to shareholders are taxed again at the individual level, leading to double taxation. Suitable for businesses seeking flexibility in ownership and growth.</li>
        <li><b>S Corporation:</b> An optional tax status elected by the corporation’s director(s). It functions similarly to a partnership for tax purposes, with profits and losses passing through to shareholders based on their ownership percentage, avoiding corporate-level taxation. This status has specific eligibility requirements, such as limits on the number and type of shareholders.</li>
      </ul>
